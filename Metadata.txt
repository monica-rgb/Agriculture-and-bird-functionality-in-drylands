Contents overview: Codes and results to perform a functional diversity, GLMs and PCoA analysis between landscape complexity, composition of natural cover, and configuration of natural cover areas for bird species diversity. For this analysis, the dataset_functional and dataset_landscape dataset was used. The result is Figures 2 and 3, and Table 1.
